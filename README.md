# Welcome to the Online Board Gamers Git!

- Everyone is welcome to contribute to the project. 
- Download and setup the source code, make a change to something you’d like to improve, and submit a PR.
- Check out the goals/git issues for ideas on where specific help is needed.

    ✅ Graphic design/art
    ✅ Backend programmers
    ✅ Website design and layout
    ✅ Anything you’d like to improve

## Short term goals
- Improve design/readability of the site; try to replace some text with icons
- Add unit testing
- Improve layout/design of the lobby / game lists / etc

## Long term goals
- More Games!
- Look at potentially moving the backend to JS to match the front end
- Look at moving hosts; carefully balance performance / costs

# Setup & Install

## Quick setup (Windows) - see below for full dockerised setup, or quick setup Linux
This will allow you to easily setup and run a home server. You can login with `admin` (super-user) or `user1` (normal user) and `password`. The easiest way to create a new user is in the Django admin panel - copy the hashed password from the `admin` user.
- Get the source code `git clone https://github.com/DodgerB85/OnlineBoardGamers-Server`
- Run `QuickSetup.bat`
- After this is done, and for future runs just run `QuickStart.bat`

## Full dockerised setup
I find it quite frustrating when I want to try out a project, only to find out it requires an obfuscated ton of setup, including setting up weird paid AWS services and pushing to remote server.
On the plus side, this project is totally free, and WILL run fine on your home computer.
On the down side, it does involve multiple steps, but each is quite small and easy, and should be easy to do if you are familiar with these tools.
If you get stuck, paste the error into AI and it should help you on to the next step.

1) Make sure you have a working Docker installation.
2) Pull the code from github. `git clone https://github.com/DodgerB85/OnlineBoardGamers-Server`
3) Copy .env.docker and rename it to just .env 
4) IMPORTANT: Ensure all docker files have "LF" line endings, not CRLF. Open in eg vs code and change the option at the bottom. (Docker, .yml, .sh files)
5) Navigate to the root of the repo and run `docker compose up --build` (MySQL port is mapped to 3307 so as not to conflict if you're running your own MySQL server)

Now browse `http://localhost:8000/` and check there are no errors
You should be able to browsr around the logged-out pages, eg about, help, etc.
(Or you might get some sort of database error). 

6) Exit back to the command prompt. Confirm containers are running using: `docker compose up -d`
7) Run this intial DB setup inside the container using `./setup_db.bat` or `docker-compose exec obs sh ./setup_db_script.sh`
8) To fix migrate errors saying a table doesn't exist, try migrating that specific table, eg `docker-compose exec obs python manage.py migrate WEB`

The compose has also created a superuser for the server - "admin" - "password" along with all required util users (eg SHADOW). All the pre-built users have their password set to their username - however the hash will be incorrect so in practive you'll need to edit in a pasxword in the admin panel, although in practice you won't ever really need to login as any of these users anyway.

9) Go back to the website, and create a normal user for yourself (Eg "DodgerB") using the "Register New Account" link
10) Now test your admin access; go to `http://localhost:8000/admin/` and login with the superuser. Find the user you made and tick them active in the User DB. Also tick Email Confirmed in their profile.
11) Back on the website, login with your new user to check it is working.
12) Before creating a game, check the admin panel to maker sure all the util users (EG "SHADOW" through to "SHADOW_5") are there.
13) On the website, create a 2-player Cannes game. It should display in the lobby. Join the game as another user.
14) Now try opening the game of Cannes - if everything works, you've made it! :)

For subsequent starts, use

`docker compose up -d`

NOTE: If you see errors involving a colon : or quotes " try opening start.sh in VS code or similar and deleting and pasting back in the bottom line. 
The issue might be to do with line end characters in linux vs windows. 
Make sure your docker files have LF and not CRLF

NOTE: You aren't required to use docker; especially if it is slow on Windows. As an alternatice, you can create a venv and install the requirements.txt files. Then run the python server and django servers inside the venv. 

## Linux / Ubuntu setup (alternative to bat files)

Install [process-compose](https://github.com/F1bonacc1/process-compose/releases) (single binary). Then:

```bash
./setup_linux.sh    # one-time setup (mirrors QuickSetup.bat)
process-compose up  # starts all services with a live TUI
```

Useful commands (or use the TUI directly):
- `process-compose process stop web` — stop a single process
- `process-compose process start web` — restart it
- `process-compose down` — stop everything

## Food Chain Magnate Agent access

FCM supports independently operated AI players through a rule-gated HTTP API,
CLI, and stdio MCP server. A signed-in human creates a passwordless Agent and its
single permanent, refreshable token at `/FCM/agent/manage/`; the Agent does not need a
normal OBG account or the human player's password. See the
[English quick start](mcp-server/README.en.md) or the
[complete Chinese guide](mcp-server/README.md).

## Deployment
There is currently no automated testing (please help with this if you can!), and deployments are done manually by running a batch script to do a git pull / collectstatic / etc.

## Production
PA runs the Django server; there's a qcluster for async tasks (not currently used due technical limitations on PA that I'm in the process of working around), and the scripts in ./siteUtils generally run once a day to perform upkeep / notification emails.
